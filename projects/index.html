        <div class="desc_div_content">
          <p>Experimentation with computer graphics has always been one of my greatest distractions from homework, but something that always sinks me back into that beautiful world of computer graphics.</p>
          <p>Here I experiment with using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise" target="_blank">Perlin Noise</a> to procedurally render realistic looking clouds. First random noise is generated on a texture. After using a clever hack to use texture blending on the noise effect to generate blended octaves of noise, I render the resulting image onto a render target and post process the entire texture with a pixel shader.</p>
          <p>I compiled everything into a PerlinCloud class which has public function prototypes</p>
          <p> PerlinCloud(LPDIRECT3DDEVICE9 d3d_device, int width, int height);<br />
            ~PerlinCloud();<br />
            LPDIRECT3DTEXTURE9 RenderTexture(unsigned long elapsed_time);<br />
            void OnLostDevice();<br />
            void OnResetDevice();</p>
          <p>and a couple other functions to tweak the cloud parameters.</p>
          <p>As can be seen from above, RenderTexture returns the handle to a texture which can be used to texture anything in a scene during render time. The class also manages object memory correctly when the device is lost/reset.</p>
          <p>The results when the texture is mapped onto a cylinder is as shown below.<br />
            <br />
            The sample is from Microsoft's DirectX SDK tutorial 5 - to show how easily the PerlinCloud class can be incorporated into other programs. I simply replaced Microsoft's default &quot;yellow spots&quot; texture with the texture handle from RenderTexture().<br />

            As a teaching assistant for the Computer Graphics course 15-462 in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Fall 2008, I wrote a project from scratch to introduce students to shaders. I lectured on shaders in general, and gave a few on-site demonstrations of GLSL. The students were then tasked to write a toon shader to produce the following results:</p>

          </a>Certainly a recommended read if you are interested in GLSL.</p>
          <p>Altogether, the feedback from students was positive, with many expressing satisfaction at being able to work with high-end computer graphics in class.</p>

    <p>O3D is capable of dynamically interacting with users via Javascript and do fancy stuff like load 3d COLLADA models from the web on the fly.<br />
      <br />
      This is in additional to its basic functionality which encompasses most of the available features of a common graphics API such as OpenGL. eg. It is able to use the programmable pipeline (vertex/pixel shaders), make use of the stencil buffer, etc.</p>
    <p>I was heavily involved in the design and implementation of the basic functionality and API classes.<br />
      I wrote a portion of the code in the COLLADA loader, fixed several performance issues in the renderers, and 
    helped to spec out and implement several rendering paradigms. I implemented back buffer resizing and proper lost device restoration and memory management in the renderers. I also helped to write the texture processors in O3D for special cases of texture coordinates.</p>
    <p>I also fully wrote and commented a full basic set of developer samples for O3D and wrote an accompanying automated testing suite. The suite uses <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank">Selenium</a> to run automated tests, testing various builds of O3D on different platforms and on a variety of samples, for robustness, reliability and efficiency. <a href="http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">PerceptualDiff</a> was used to compare screenshots taken during the testing phase with actual reference images.</p>

Also coded a routing daemon for the IRC server which allows uses OSPF for routing.</p>
    <p>IRC server communicates with local routing daemon via TCP and routing daemon communicates with other daemons via UDP.</p>
    <p>Routing tables were recalculated on every link state update. Dijkstra's was used to finding the shortest path given the current routing state. The results were cached for performance.</p>

    <p>A round robin scheduler was used, together with a sleep queue, which uses linked list primitives.<br />
      Malloc functions were guarded with a spin-lock mutexes, and the user threading library also uses spin-lock to guard all critical sections.</p>

    <p>Zero fill on demand optimization implemented to save time on forking empty pages.</p>
    <p>Wait and vanish kernel interrupts use more mutexes to guard the entire tree of process and thread control blocks.<br />
      The print and readline kernel interrupts use a special blocking mutex to block other threads trying to access the mutex till the current thread is done with the critical sections, after which it reactivates the next in the queue and context switches to it.

    <p>I was tasked to write three device drivers to be compiled into a device driver library and linked with the Pebbles kernel, for our Operating Systems Design and Implementation class in CMU.</p>
    <p>A game application, the SameGame, was to be written and run on top of my library.</p>
    <p>Three device drivers were written from scratch: A console driver, a timer driver, and a keyboard driver.</p>
    <p>The console driver writes directly to graphics-adaptor mapped memory to display output, and communicates with the CRTC to modify cursor positions. The timer driver uses the system I/O ports to communicate its period, and set its mode to square wave. The keyboard driver &quot;talks&quot; directly to the keyboard via the keyboard i/o ports.</p>
    <p>I wrote the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame" target="_blank">SameGame</a> which rests on top of the device driver library that i coded.</p>

    <p>The problem description can be viewed <a href="http://wildnoodle.com/ic2007r2/Tutorial.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Basically, given a connected graph of N<sup>3</sup> nodes (representing brain neurons), we are supposed to map each node to a unique coordinate of a N x N x N cube. The only constraint is that Node 0 must be mapped to the bottom left vertex and node (N<sup>3</sup> -1) must be mapped to the upper right vertex. Note that this is a one-to-one mapping since the cube has exactly N<sup>3</sup> vertices or coordinates.</p>
    <p>The objective is to <strong>minimize</strong> the <strong>total  cartesian distance</strong> of connections between the nodes.</p>
    <p>E.g.</p>
    <p><img src="img/ex-2D.gif" width="218" height="283" /></p>
    <p><em>Given a graph with 8 (2<sup>3</sup>) vertices,</em></p>
    <p><img src="img/ex-3D.gif" width="324" height="264" /><br />
      <em>Map it onto a 2x2x2 cube. (Images from Microsoft / Wildnoodle) </em></p>
    <p>I experimented with many algorithms at first, a couple being a creative physics simulation (in which connections were springs exerted forces), and a complicated metaheuristic algorithm called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization" target="_blank">Ant Colony Optimization</a>, which yielded fascinating results.</p>
    <p>We were scored based on time taken for the algorithm to run to completion and the total length of connections of the resultant cube. The challenge was finding an algorithm that was quick enough, yet producing satisfying results.</p>
    <p>Eventually it occured to me that clever search pruning was the key to solving the problem. (A 16x16x16 cube had tons of neighboring states!) It turned out that using a pruned form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing" target="_blank">simulated annealing</a>, followed by a couple of iterations of a greedy algorithm, together with a modified <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search" target="_blank">tabu search</a>, yielded outstanding results. This qualified me for the world finals of the Microsoft ImagineCup competition in Seoul, Korea, in which I emerged top 6 worldwide.</p>
